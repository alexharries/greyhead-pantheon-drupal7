 * This file should be renamed to "local_settings.php" and moved into the project
 * root when an automagic deployment takes place using the deploy.sh script
 * (which is located in the parent directory above this template).
 *
 *      Use this file to set server- or deployment-specific configuration
 *      overrides; typically, this is used to set a memcached server IP address.
