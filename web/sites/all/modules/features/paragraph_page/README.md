# paragraph_page
Paragraph Page Drupal 7 Feature: provides a Paragraph Page content type with a wide range of configurable paragraph types. Requires the Paragraphs module, a Bootstrap-based them (yes, stop complaining at the back of the class :P) and many, many other things. This code is work-in-progress, so it's best avoided like a mixture of the plague and Justin Bieber.
